                    We are a community of riders. 
                    Founded in 2018 in Harrisonburg, Virginia we 
                    founded Shenandoah Cycling Club for all skill levels, 
                    from the pro rider to the rider who is brand new. 
                    Dedicated to always including everyone who has even the slightest 
                    passion for the sport. After a few years of having the club we 
                    have expanded to having weekly rides, hosting races, and even throwing 
                    club parties. Shenandoah Cycling Club is always expanding 
                    and even offers road bikes and mountain bikes for rent if 
                    you need a set of wheels.
                    <p> 
                        We are excited and ambitous for growing our club in the next year to 
                        having multiple sites outside of Harrisonburg including Charlottesville
                         and Front Royal. If you are interested in getting more information or joining

        Report:<br><br>
        This project is about a fake bike club that I wish they would make real.<br>
        Every image and idea is my own.<br>
        The website consists of 5 pages. 
        Home, About Us, Events, Local Rides, and Become a Member.<br>
        There is a shared header that is used on every page.
        That include naviagtion links to the different pages.<br>
        My project works for smaller screen.<br>
        The style is coherent throughout the site with a bike/outdoorsy theme that 
        are demonstrated through images and font sizes and colors.<br>
        My site has multiple images set as images and even background images, each with useful
        alt tags. On every page the user visits there is a clear bike favicon.<br>
        My project is organized with css files and image files in their own folder.
        There are no imported libraries or frameworks, only ideas.<br>
        Each page and stylesheet has no warnings. Everything on the project flows
        with use of centering and cohesive alignment. There are bleeding text issues.<br>
        My site uses san-serif and serif, only used two to keep the style the same.
        I use a form for the member box, but des not have functionality 
        if you click "Join Now".<br>
        I have two distinct links. One taking users to Strava for more routes and the 
        other going to the Specialized store.<br>
        The source code is clear and organized using kebab-case. My site has oneanimation 
        on the button for the homepage.<br>
        I have shared the project with user hcientist.<br>
        Fianlly, I ran all my code through the Nu Validator and there are no warnings or errors.<br>

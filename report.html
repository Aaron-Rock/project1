        Report:<br \> 
        This project is about a fake bike club that I wish they would make real.<br \>
        Every image and idea is my own.<br \>
        The website consists of 5 pages. 
        Home, About Us, Events, Local Rides, and Become a Member.<br \>
        There is a shared header that is used on every page.
        That include naviagtion links to the different pages.<br \>
        As of now my page does not allow for smaller screen (still working).<br \>
        The style is coherent throughout the site with a bike/outdoorsy theme that 
        are demonstrated through images and font sizes and colors.<br \>
        My site has multiple images set as images and even background images, each with useful
        alt tags. On every page the user visits there is a clear bike favicon.<br \>
